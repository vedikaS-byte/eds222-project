# Assessing Sea Otter Feeding Habitats Based on Prey Type and Dive Depth

## Purpose

The sea otter (*Enhydra lutris*) is a highly social marine mammal that plays a vital role as a keystone species in maintaining the health of kelp forest ecosystems by controlling sea urchin populations. Although sea otters are primary predators of sea urchins, their diet is diverse and includes a wide variety of prey types. For example, sea otters in Alaska are known to consume a wide range of prey, including clams, crabs, sea urchins, sea cucumbers, and snails (LaRoche et al., 2018). In recolonized areas of Southeast Alaska, clams are strongly selected despite their relatively low abundance, reflecting their high quality value. Similarly, sea urchins dominate diets primarily in rocky reef habitats where they are more abundant (LaRoche et al., 2018).

The proportion of prey not eaten provides a measure of foraging efficiency and prey handling success, reflecting both biological constraints and behavioral choices during feeding. Because of their important role as a keystone species, understanding their diet and foraging patterns is essential for assessing feeding preferences and food availability in conservation.

This blog post aims to present and discuss the results of a statistical regression analysis conducted on sea otter foraging data collected from visual observations in Prince of Wales, Alaska, by LaRoche et al. (2018). A beta regression using `glmmTMB` with a zero-adjustment was selected for the analysis in order to assess the proportion of prey not consumed by sea otters during summer 2018. The following question was utilized to guide the analysis:

**How does prey categorization and dive depth predict the proportion of prey not eaten?**

The mean proportion not eaten was modeled using a Beta regression with a logit link, while a precision parameter (ϕ) captured the variability in proportions around the mean.

$$
\text{PropNotEaten} \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha, \beta)
$$

$$
logit(\mu_i)
= \beta_{0}
+ \beta_{diveTime} 
+ \beta_{PreyCat\_urchin} 
+ \beta_{PreyCat\_crab} 
+ \beta_{PreCat\_cucumber} 
+ \beta_{PreCat\_star}  
$$

-   **Hypothesis 1:**

    -   H~0~: β~PreyCat_urchins~ = 0. Sea otters leave the same proportion of urchins uneaten as they do with clams; prey category does not influence the proportion of prey eaten.

    -   H~A~: β~PreyCat_urchins~ ≠ 0. Sea otters leave a significantly different proportion of urchins uneaten compared to clams; prey category has a significant effect on the proportion of prey not eaten.

-   **Hypothesis 2**:

    -   H~0~: β~dive_time~ = 0. Dive time has no significant effect on the proportion of prey not eaten; the duration of a dive does not influence how much prey is not eaten.

    -   H~A~: β~dive_time~ ≠ 0. Dive time does significantly affect the proportion of prey not eaten; longer or shorter dives are associated with a higher or lower proportion of prey left uneaten.

The categorical variable `PreyCat` represents the general prey categorization of a prey type. In particular, clams and urchins differ biologically in handling difficulty and energetic return. Urchins may require more processing and include defensive structures (spines), whereas clams require shell-breaking but offer concentrated soft tissue. These differences potentially influence the proportion of prey successfully consumed, indicating a direct causal effect of prey category on the proportion of prey not consumed

Additionally, prey category may influence dive duration (continuous numeric variable) because hunting, handling, and extracting different prey may require different levels of effort and time. Thus, prey category potentially influences dive time, which in turn affects the proportion of prey not eaten.

## Data Availability and Characteristics

### Data Access

The data used in this project were obtained from the [KNB Data Repository](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/view/doi%3A10.5063%2FF1C53J8X) and are based on the finalized foraging dataset "Sea otter foraging data, visual observations from Prince of Wales, Alaska*”* compiled by Nicole LaRoche, Sydney King, and Heidi Pearson (2018). LaRoche et al. documented sea otter diets from May to August 2018 using visual observations conducted along the western coast of Prince of Wales Island, Alaska, at sites characterized by high otter densities. The finalized foraging dataset is publicly accessible as a CSV file through the KNB Data Repository.

### Data Importation, Exploration, and Processing

The foraging dataset used in this project had been previously cleaned by the original authors. However, additional processing was required, including adjusting variables to appropriate ranges and removing missing values. Therefore, further preprocessing steps were necessary before conducting the analyses.

Here, I loaded the necessary packages for the analysis and then imported the dataset by providing the correct file path to `read_csv()`.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show code"
#| output: false
#| warning: false
library(here) 
library(tidyverse)
# https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/betareg/vignettes/betareg.html#sec-model
library(glmmTMB)
library(broom)         
library(broom.mixed) # for glmmTMB mixed model
library(kableExtra)
```

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| output: false
set.seed(123) # For reproducibility
forage <- read_csv("forage_final.csv")
```

Missing values (NAs) were removed prior to analysis. I then selected only the variables required for modeling: prey category (`PreyCat`), dive time (`DT`), and proportion not eaten (`PropNotEat`). Column names were also updated for clarity. Additionally, I generated a summary table showing the number of observations within each prey category and verified that all `NAs` had been removed from the selected variables using `colSums()` in combination with `is.na()`.

```{r}
# Select for just prey category and diving time
forage <- forage %>% select(PreyCat, PropNotEat, DT)
#forage <- forage %>% filter(age != "U")
forage <- forage %>% drop_na() 
#forage <- forage %>% filter(PreyCat != "PreyCatMussel", PreyCat != "PreyCatSnail")
table(forage$PreyCat)
```

```{r}
# Check the colSums to ensure all NAs are dropped
colSums(is.na(forage)) 
```

Visualizing the initial data distribution was also helpful. I opted to use a scatterplot to show the relationship between dive time (a continuous numeric variable) and the proportion of prey not eaten by prey category, along with a boxplot to display the distribution of uneaten prey within each category.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show code"
# Create a scatterplot of dive time related to the proportion of prey not eaten based on prey category
forage %>% ggplot(aes(x = DT, y = PropNotEat, col = PreyCat)) + 
  geom_jitter()  +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_color_discrete(palette = "Set2") + 
  labs(x = "Diving Time (seconds)", 
       y = "Proportion of Prey Not Eaten", 
       title = "Proportion of Prey Not Consumed By Sea Otters Based on Diving Time and /nPrey Category") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 11, face = "bold"))

# Create boxplots to visualize the distribution of prey categories and proportion of prey not eaten
forage %>% ggplot(aes(x = PreyCat, y = PropNotEat, fill = PreyCat)) + geom_boxplot() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(
    "Clam" = "#1b9e77",
    "Urchin" = "#d95f02",
    "Crab" = "#7570b3",
    "Cucumber" = "#66a61e",
    "Star" = "#e6ab02"
  )) + theme_bw()
```

From the scatterplot, it appears that sea otters spending roughly 25-100 seconds on prey often leave around 50% or even 100% of clams and crabs uneaten, suggesting potentially wasteful behavior. Most prey left uneaten cluster around 50% for clams, crabs, and sea cucumbers, and between 25-175 seconds for sea urchins. Notably, longer prey handling times, which are associated with deeper dives, are linked to lower proportions of prey left uneaten, typically under 25-50%, especially for clams, urchins, and crabs. The boxplot shows that starfish have a higher median proportion left uneaten than other prey categories, while sea cucumbers have the lowest median. Sea urchins also tend to be left uneaten less often than clams.

### Data Simulation Procedure

Prior to constructing a model based on real world data, it is important to simulate data to confirm that the

Here, I simulated data was generated to evaluate model performance, explore parameter recovery, and verify that the fitted model behaves as expected. As cited in the `betareg` CRAN project, the

```{r}

forage <- forage %>%
  mutate(PropNotEat_adj = # Transformation to adjust (betareg cranr)

  PropNotEat_adj ~ PreyCat * DT,

```

For future analysis, the age (adult and juvenile) of observed sea otters may be considered as a potential confounding variable impacting diving time, preference for prey, and the proportion of prey left uneaten.
